Two experimental paths remain under development:
Worm towers for in-ground applications, which require species capable of deep burrowing (Lumbricus terrestris) rather than surface decomposition (Eisenia foetida).
3D printing with humus-based biomaterials, a promising but technically challenging line. Preliminary trials mixing 10–15% humus with clay achieved partial success; higher proportions led to excessive plasticity and oxygen deprivation for living organisms. Future work will focus on formulations optimized for biodegradable seed trays and soil-reintegrable components.
