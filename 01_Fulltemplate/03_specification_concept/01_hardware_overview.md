## foreseen cost (money and time)
The required cost is very low. A 15-liter ceramic pot can range between €15–30 depending on the country.

There is also a non-recurring cost that is useful for activating our vermicomposter: the initial worm colony and some good-quality soil, so that the worms do not suffer when settling in. For around €20 you can obtain a handful of worms (about 500 individuals), and if you wish to purchase humus — which can also be used for your garden — a 40-liter bag costs approximately €20.

Time, however, is a determining factor. At the beginning, you will need to check the vermicomposter almost daily in order to adjust it. Once it is functioning properly, you should tend to it two or three times per week. If there are more extreme temperatures — either hot or cold — you should check it almost every day.
