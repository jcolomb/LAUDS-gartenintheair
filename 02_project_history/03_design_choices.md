**Material Sourcing and Selection**

Primary structural element: traditional fired ceramic pots (15 L) from regional potteries in the Guadalquivir valley. Pots are selected for porosity, dimensional standardisation, and existing supply chains.
Hack components: bespoke lids, capillary distributors, internal trays and seed templates produced by digital fabrication (3D printing in ceramic composite or PLA biocomposite).
Biological input: Eisenia fetida worm communities and local organic residues.

**Design Adaptation and Digital Fabrication**

Parametric design (Rhino + Grasshopper) generates adaptable geometries for retrofitting standard pot sizes. Designs produce: (a) lid inserts that match pot rims; (b) tray geometries that fit pot interior contours; (c) capillary channel patterns for condensate distribution.
Additive fabrication produces the hack components: 3D-printed lids (ceramic composite or clay in lab trials), internal trays (PLA/biocomposite), and small fixtures for anchorage to mashrabiya panels. Where ceramic printing is not feasible, components are printed in PLA biocomposite and later transitioned to fired ceramic versions via collaboration with local kilns.

**Mechanical and Hydraulic Integration (Hacking Traditional Pots)**

The hack operation consists of: (a) preparing the pot rim and interior to receive inserts (minor drilling, chamfering, or application of sealing gaskets where necessary); (b) fitting the custom lid that captures condensate and distributes it across the pot surface through microchannels; (c) installing stackable internal trays that create layered habitats, drainage paths, and aeration.
All modifications are reversible and preserve the integrity of the traditional pot, enabling reusability or return to standard horticultural use.

**Community Assembly and Calibration**

Hacking sessions are organised as participatory workshops with AES Candelaria students and local potters. These sessions include instruction on fitting inserts, maintenance protocols, and simple diagnostic checks (moisture, ventilation, leachate collection).
Performance calibration (moisture rates, worm activity, thermal buffering) is measured in situ and iteratively used to refine both the parametric designs and the installation procedure.

**Closed-Loop Testing and Material Trials**

Produced humus is applied to pot substrates and the association’s urban plots to close the material loop.
Parallel experiments at Fab Lab Sevilla test humus–clay mixtures for future fired components (seed trays, degradable supports), ensuring that any new ceramic parts remain compatible with the traditional pottery supply chain.
