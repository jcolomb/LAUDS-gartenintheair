## Validation {#sec-validation}

> How do you know the hardware works ?

Elaborate how the hardware technically/methodologically advances the state-of-the-art, including references to relevant research articles and online references.

This may be important for future development, as new validation cycles would probably build on this documentation.
Indicate any sofware/code used for validation of the design.

You can indicate whether the whether the thing has been made (and by whom) and verifies that it is makeable.
This section should indicate whether the thing has been made independently using the documentation by someone who was not a contributor to the design or documentation and, therefore, verifies that the documentation is sufficient to make the thing.
