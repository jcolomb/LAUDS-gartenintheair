## Metadata {#sec-metadata}

Different metadata format were created. The original [OKH](https://standards.internetofproduction.org/pub/okh/release/1), was transformed into the 
[LOSH](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/OKH-LOSH/blob/master/OKH-LOSH.md) version. 
Unfortunately, the two metadata formats are not compatible and both versions
are not used at scale.

In these conditions, it might be best to create these files on request.
Giving your project an [OSHWA certification](https://certification.oshwa.org) (if it is an open source project) might still be the best way to make your project more discoverable.
