# Hacking a plant pot in a vermicomposter

We provide here a guide to hack a plant pot and transform it into a vermicomposter,
a modular system that can be adapted to both vertical and horizontal configurations.

## Vision: Vermicomposter for Mediterranean Climates.

We aim to share and improve a functional vermicomposter designed for outdoor environments in Mediterranean climates,
which can be adapted to both vertical and horizontal settings in urban contexts.
The documentation is intended to facilitate the adaptation of the design to different local conditions and to materials that are readily available.

## Problem description

The lack of fertile soil is common in urban contexts, and its regeneration requires multiple actions.
Vermicomposting is one of the simplest ways to integrate our daily environments into this regenerative process.
Plant pots represent a traditional, widely accepted technology that enhances vermicomposting practices:
they are aesthetically compatible and serve as effective hygrothermal regulators.

## Project history and roadmap

The project builds upon the experience of Gardens in the Air (Nomad Garden, 2021–2023),
a vertical garden implemented on the façade of AES Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria in Seville,
irrigated with condensate water recovered from air-conditioning systems.

The LAUDS framework provided an opportunity to address several constraints
through maker methodologies, participatory prototyping, and open-source design processes.
During the early stages, community feedback from AES Candelaria encouraged us to rethink
the initial vertical-garden concept and explore the integration of the organic carbon cycle
alongside the existing water cycle in the condensate system.

From this reflection emerged a new hypothesis: it is possible to produce fertile soil
within the built environment by embedding vermicomposting systems into both vertical and horizontal structures.
The resulting design — Redesigning Gardens in the Air — aimed to close local material loops
by transforming daily organic waste into humus and reintegrating it into urban cultivation.

The technical challenge lies in adapting this natural process to outdoor, façade-oriented environments,
using bioclimatic ceramic containers capable of buffering temperature fluctuations
through evaporative cooling powered by recovered condensate water.

Next steps:

- Ensure compatibility with other parametric design software

- Open the project for feedback and external contributions

- Test the system in different contexts (urban orchards, community gardens, etc.)

Long term:

-   build a network of vermicomposter initiatives to enable self-managed development of the project
